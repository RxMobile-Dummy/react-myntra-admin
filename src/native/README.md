## Tech components

- **React Native**
  - React Native is one of the most popular front-end JavaScript and TypeScript libraries for building cross platform mobile applications. It is actively maintained by Meta and a community of skilled developers and companies.

- **TypeScript**
  - TypeScript Code is converted into Plain JavaScript Code: TypeScript code canâ€™t be natively interpreted by browsers. So if the code was written in TypeScript, it gets compiled and converted into JavaScript. This process is known as Trans-piled. With the help of JavaScript code, browsers are able to read the code and display it.
  - JavaScript is TypeScript: Whatever code is written in JavaScript can be converted to TypeScript by changing the extension from .js to .ts.
  - Use TypeScript anywhere: TypeScript can be compiled to run on any browser, device, or operating system. TypeScript is not specific to any single environment.
  - TypeScript supports JS libraries: With TypeScript, developers can use already existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, or call the TS Code from native JavaScript code.

- **Redux**
